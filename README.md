# Manga InDesign Scripts

#### ReversePageNumberer
1. Create a new parent page, for example: Prefix "C" with the name "PageNumber"
2. Create a new layer for page numbers, for example: "Page Numbers"
3. Inside the new parent, insert blank text frames on the left and right pages with your page number's preferred style or formatting
4. For each page you'd like to insert a page number on, put the page in focus and run the script
    - You can also select individual pages through the pages panel by double-clicking a page then then running the script

Note: You can also adjust your page number layer and parent names as well as the starting page number through the ["Adjustable parameters" section](ReversePageNumberer.js#L6) of the script
